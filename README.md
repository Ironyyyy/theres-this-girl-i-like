she has the prettiest smile, and the sweetest voice, I love it when she talks, I find it funny. I like it when she's clingy, and when she spams me in our dms just to tell me to go on pony town, I like how she gives me these nicknames that really has no corellation to my name but, I still find it quite cute. We don't talk as often anymore but everytime we do, she makes me feel happy and warm and nice and happy and fun and i feel a rush of euphoria and I feel good about my life. Her laugh is very contagious and it's quite sweet listening to it. She's always so considerate about my feelings and idk I feel happy when I'm with her. I don't know if I like her or if I just like the idea of having her beside me but, I really like her.
